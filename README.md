# FRBs-Classification
 The mysterious fast radio bursts (FRBs) are classified as repeating ones and apparently non-repeating ones. While repeating FRBs cannot be classified into the non-repeating group, it is unknown whether the apparently non-repeating FRBs are actually repeating FRBs whose repetitions are yet to be discovered, or whether they belong to another physically distinct type from the repeating ones. We train the machine learning algorithms with a fraction of the observed FRBs in the first CHIME/FRB catalog, telling them which ones are apparently non-repeating and which ones are repeating. We then let the trained models predict the repetitiveness of the rest of the FRB data with the observed parameters, and we compare the predictions with the observed repetitiveness.
